# Classify-Images-of-Birds-into-One-of-200-Species

## Overview

The goal of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model that can classify images of birds into one of 200 species. Given an image of a bird, the model should correctly identify its species based on visual features.

## Description

Birds are one of the most diverse and fascinating species on Earth, playing a vital role in ecosystems as pollinators, seed dispersers, and environmental indicators. Identifying bird species from images is a challenging task due to variations in pose, lighting, and background clutter. Traditionally, bird classification requires expert ornithologists to analyze physical characteristics, which is both time-consuming and prone to human error.

In this challenge, your task is to develop a machine learning model that can classify birds into one of 200 species based on image data.
